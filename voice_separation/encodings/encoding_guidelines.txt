missing and misplaced barlines
- comment must be
  {@no barline in source}
  {@misplaced barline in source}
- get no separate footnote, but are gathered in one single statement at the end of the 
  footnotes. this applies also to missing non-standard barlines
  - see phalese-1547_7-tant_que-4vv.tbp, b. 12

altered barlines (in semantics, not in looks (e.g., three-line closing barlines)) 
- get a separate footnote, possibly combined with any directly following footnote event 
  - see phalese-1547_7-tant_que-4vv.tbp, bb. 11-12 (2x)

a sequence of events that has a footnote can cross a barline

REDUCTION is described in the ISMIR 2019 paper as
- "the factor by which the durations in the tablature must be multiplied (or divided) in order for its nominal 
  beat level to correspond to that of the vocal model. the reduction can be a positive integer greater than 1,
  in which case it amounts to an augmentation; a negative integer, in which case it amounts to a reduction; or 
  1, in which case the durations do not change"
  - REDUCTION = 1 (no change): the default durations of the tablature rhythm symbols stay the same
  - REDUCTION = 2 (augmentation): the default durations of the tablature rhythm symbols are doubled
  - REDUCTION = -2 (reduction): the default durations of the tablature rhythm symbols are doubled
- applies only to datasets created using TabMapper (e.g., josquIntab), where an _automatic_ mapping of tablature notes to 
  voices from the vocal model (MIDI file) is done
- does not apply to datasets created manually (e.g., thesis-int), where a _manual_ mapping of tablature notes to voices
  from the vocal model (PDF file) is done. here, REDUCTION is always 1: the default durations of the tablature rhythm 
  symbols are kept fixed, and instead the durations in the vocal model are interpreted flexible (i.e., read as reduced/augmented)

transcription of tablature rhythm symbols in MEI tab + score. two options (see #ig-tablature message on 17.12.2021)
- (1) fix the default set of tablature rhythm symbols and simply do a 1:1 transcription (current MEIExport approach using reduceCMNDur = true)
  - set @tab.dur.sym.ratio on <staffDef> to '1' (or leave it out)
  - add no @dur to the <tabDurSym> - the presence of <tabDurSym> only indicates that there is a RS; its duration is fixed
  - add the (default) @dur to the <tabGrp> 
  - add the same @dur to the corresponding <note>(s)
- (2) scale the default set of tablature rhythm symbols and do a temporally augmented or reduced transcription (TODO in MEI)
  - set @tab.dur.sym.ratio on <staffDef> to '<n>', where <n> is the scaling factor (>1 for augmentation; <0 for reduction)
  - add the default @dur to the <tabDurSym> - to indicate its default value
  - add the scaled @dur to the <tabGrp> - it can be derived automatically using tab.dur.sym.ratio. e.g., 
    - tab.dur.sym.ratio='2'  --> a default @dur of 2 scales to a @dur of 1 (half to whole note; doubling)
    - tab.dur.sym.ratio='-2' --> a default @dur of 2 scales to a @dur of 4 (half to quarter note; halving) 
  - add the same scaled @dur to the corresponding <note>(s)
--> for uniformity in approach, the second method can be used for option (1) as well, setting @tab.dur.sym.ratio on 
    <staffDef> to '1' and using the same @dur on <tabDurSym> and <tabGrp> - but maybe this is not as clean as there is 
    some redundancy now (one of the @dur can go)
