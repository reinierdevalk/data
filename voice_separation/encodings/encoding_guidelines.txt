comments
- must be placed directly after the event they refer to, before the SS + space (.>.) following that event
- in case of multiple events being replaced (either by one or more events)
  - the comment must be placed after the first event of the replacement, i.e., at onset of the replaced event
  - the following replacement events must all be followed by an empty footnote {@}
  - example: 
    mi.a5.g3.f2.f1.>. 
    replaced by 
    sm-.a5.g3.f2.f1.>.fu-.f1.>.fu.f1.>.  
    becomes
    sm-.a5.g3.f2.f1{@'mi.a5.g3.f2.f1.' in source}.>.fu-.f1{@}.>.fu.f1{@}.>.

missing and misplaced barlines
- comment must be
  {@no barline in source}
  {@misplaced barline in source}
- get no separate footnote, but are gathered in one single statement at the end of the 
  footnotes. this applies also to missing non-standard barlines
  - see phalese-1547_7-tant_que-4vv.tbp, b. 12

altered barlines (in semantics, not in looks (e.g., three-line closing barlines)) 
- get a separate footnote, possibly combined with any directly following footnote event 
  - see phalese-1547_7-tant_que-4vv.tbp, bb. 11-12 (2x)

a sequence of events that has a footnote can cross a barline
- see adriansen-1584_6-d_vn_si.tbp, bb. 24-25

diminution (TabMapper)
- why? meter in tab and model MIDI are not always the same but are often 'nominally proportioned' (i.e., 
  halved or doubled) -- but should be to enable mapping 
- in case of meter mismatches, the durations in the model MIDI (and not those in the tab) should be adapted, 
  using the DIMINUTION values given in the tab 
- thus, the TabMapper output (the mapped transcriptions) have the same durations as those in as the tab
  - this is good, as the rhythm flags in the tab should always represent the same duration to be usable 
    for ML tasks
- how it works
  - DIMINUTION = 1 (no change): the durations in the model are the same as those given in the tab                                 
  - DIMINUTION = 2 (diminution): the durations in the model are halved w.r.t. to those given in the tab
  - DIMINUTION = -2 (augmentation): the durations in the model are doubled w.r.t. to those given in the tab  
- examples
  - 1025_adieu_mes_amours
    tab: 2/2; model: 2/1; dim: 2; mapped: 2/2
  - 5106_10_misa_de_faysan_regres_2_gloria
    tab: 2/1, 3/2; model: 2/1, 3/1; dim: 1, 2; mapped: 2/1, 3/2
- diminution applies only to the data in data/annotated/tabmapper/josquin-int/tab/; in the case of the data in 
  data/annotated/voice_separation/encodings/thesis-int/, DIMINUTION is always 1
  - the default durations of the tab rhythm symbols are kept fixed when creating the ground truth transcriptions, 
    and instead the durations in the vocal model (PDF) are interpreted flexibly (i.e., read as reduced/augmented)
    --> the rhythm flags always represent the same durations
- NB: diminution ("reduction") is described in the ISMIR 2019 paper as
  "the factor by which the durations in the tablature must be multiplied (or divided) in order for its nominal 
  beat level to correspond to that of the vocal model. the reduction can be a positive integer greater than 1,
  in which case it amounts to an augmentation; a negative integer, in which case it amounts to a reduction; or 
  1, in which case the durations do not change"
  - this is incorrect: it should be the other way around (as described above), and has been inplemented as such 
    since

transcription of tablature rhythm symbols in MEI tab + score. two options (see #ig-tablature message on 17.12.2021)
- (1) fix the default set of tablature rhythm symbols and simply do a 1:1 transcription (current MEIExport approach)
  - set @tab.dur.sym.ratio on <staffDef> to '1' (or leave it out)
  - add no @dur to the <tabDurSym> - the presence of <tabDurSym> only indicates that there is a RS; its duration is fixed
  - add the (default) @dur to the <tabGrp> 
  - add the same @dur to the corresponding <note>(s)
- (2) scale the default set of tablature rhythm symbols and do a temporally augmented or reduced transcription (TODO in MEI)
  - set @tab.dur.sym.ratio on <staffDef> to '<n>', where <n> is the scaling factor (>1 for augmentation; <0 for reduction)
  - add the default @dur to the <tabDurSym> - to indicate its default value
  - add the scaled @dur to the <tabGrp> - it can be derived automatically using tab.dur.sym.ratio. e.g., 
    - tab.dur.sym.ratio='2'  --> a default @dur of 2 scales to a @dur of 1 (half to whole note; doubling)
    - tab.dur.sym.ratio='-2' --> a default @dur of 2 scales to a @dur of 4 (half to quarter note; halving) 
  - add the same scaled @dur to the corresponding <note>(s)
--> for uniformity in approach, the second method can be used for option (1) as well, setting @tab.dur.sym.ratio on 
    <staffDef> to '1' and using the same @dur on <tabDurSym> and <tabGrp> - but maybe this is not as clean as there is 
    some redundancy now (one of the @dur can go)
